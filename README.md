InvoiceCreator is a personal project built with React to practice and learn modern web development concepts.
It connects to a n8n workflow to fetch invoice information and generates a PDF invoice automatically.

About
This project was created for training purposes to improve my skills in:

React development

API integration

Workflow automation with n8n

Dynamic PDF generation

While the app is functional in principle, it is not fully production-ready:

It relies on external APIs (for PDF creation and n8n workflows) that are not unlimited and may restrict usage.

Some small technical details still need to be refined.

Nevertheless, the main goals of learning and exploration have been fully achieved with this project.
